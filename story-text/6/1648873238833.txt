I (27M) love my brother (35M) but I absolutely do not trust him to live with me. My parents are begging me to let him stay there while he gets on his feet and they’ll even send me money (they live outside of the US and he wouldn’t be able to move). He falls into his drug habits every time and ends up getting arrested for whatever reasons. While he doesn’t bring that to the house, the reason why I won’t let him stay is because I live in low income housing apartments.If someone stays with me longer than a week then they need to be added to the contract. He can’t be added because if he is and gets arrested for whatever reason then *I* lose my apartment and get evicted. My son (6) lives with me and I don’t want to risk his home. My parents are saying I’m acting like he’ll do something to jeopardize our living situation. They think he’s allowed to be given a chance because this time it won’t be just him affected if he messes up but us too and he’d never do anything like that to us. He cares about family so knowing that we’d be without a place will motivate him to not get into trouble. While it’s true that’s still not a risk I’d be willing to take. Nobody will leave me alone about it because he needs somewhere to stay. He’s at my cousins right now but he will need to leave soon (cousin is moving) and won’t have anywhere to go soon. And supposedly it’s important for his recovery to have a safe place. It sucks he’s in this situation, like I wish I could believe he won’t do anything. It’s just my son having a home is more important than anything. Everywhere else in LA is crazy expensive right now. The apartments where we live is great because rent isn’t so bad and my son has his own room. That wouldn’t be possible anywhere else in this city. So we can’t lose this place. Now that makes me a bad brother to them so I don’t know what to think. AITA?
