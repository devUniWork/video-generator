The title without context sounds kinda bad but at least read what happened. I (21M) was walking into a supermarket the other day and there was a guy in a wheelchair coming in behind me and I held the door for him. I was just trying to be polite I would’ve held the door for anyone. Anyway he says something to the affect of “wow dude you’re just holding the door because I’m in a wheelchair I could’ve done it myself”. I thought this was a pretty rude response to someone trying to be polite but whatever. Then once he’s in the store he follows me and goes on and on about how just because he’s in a wheelchair doesn’t mean I need to “infantilize” him or something like that. I just ignored him at first but then he wouldn’t stop talking about it so I kinda snapped and said “I was just trying to be nice man, fuck off”. He looked all taken back and just gave me a scowl and left. I told my mom the story later and she said I overreacted.AITA
