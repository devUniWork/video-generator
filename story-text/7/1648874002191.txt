I live in a rent controlled 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other room mates (all in our 30s). Rent is very cheap (I do pay extra for underground parking) and we've been here for almost almost 6 years now. They are clean, quiet and, don't abuse overnight visitors, chip in for maid service, and we each have our own shitter/shower so it's a great living situation.They overheard me talking to the property manager about having an EV charger installed in the underground parking garage some day. Property manager essentially said lol fuck no but then one roommate asked what kind of vehicle I am getting so I told them I had put down a $100 deposit for an F150 lightning last spring. She asked how I can afford that vehicle given how I'm so frugal and drive a 15 year old corolla. She had known I work at a power plant but didn't know my wage so I told her that I've worked my way up to panel operator and make about $156k base.She flipped and accused me of being a monster for taking affordable housing away from struggling people like her sister who can no longer even find places like this. Then came the demand that I move out so her sister can move in which I very much opted to decline.Truth is the low living expenses here is the linchpin that is making it possible for me to invest to retire early at around 50 years old. I have zero intention of leaving here unless I move in with a S/O (not any time soon as I am single). Other roomie doesn't seem to care at all.AITA?
