My (24F) sister in law V(31F) is blaming me for her divorce with my brother (34M).  Some years ago my brother got married to V, she was super nice and sweet to me. The problem started when I got pregnant. My sister announced her pregnancy before me so when I announced my pregnancy she was absolutely livid. She started saying that she didn’t want to share a pregnancy with anyone else and how selfish I was. I told her that it wasn’t all about her and left it at that. After that she started doing things to act like the victim. For example, I told people my gender reveal date 1 month prior. V then decided she was going to have another gender reveal “to make sure the baby’s gender is exact” which was complete bs but then got mad and threw a fit when my brother came to mine instead of her. Another thing she did is when I was in labor she faked contractions so the attention could be off me. When my brother confronted her she started crying and saying “if you care about your sister so much why didn’t you marry her” that was 3 months ago. Now my brother and V are getting a divorce because he feels like she has been centering the pregnancy on me and not the actual baby. She didn’t help in things like buy the baby clothes, a dresser, changing table, or decorate the room prior to the baby’s birth. Last night she sent me a string of texts saying I am a bitch and insinuating that I’m having sexual relations with my brother. I’m actually fuming right now but I want to make sure I’m not the asshole if u end up retaliating.
